<h1> Deep Dive 3 </h1>
<h3> Jessica Camacho <h3>
<h3> Geography 485L </h3>
<h2>This deep dive is the first of two (plus milestones) that are related to a common theme of taking an online mapping problem from start to finish - from the definition of a problem, through the implementation of services and a basic client interface for the display of data for the specific problem.</h2>
<h2>Before beginning to work on any mapping problem (online or otherwise), some basic questions need to asked and answered. Please consider and answer (in 2-4 sentences as appropriate for the question) the following questions relating to the problem that you will be working on for the forthcoming assignments:</h2>

<p>Hurricane Sandy was a major hurricane that hit the east coast of the United States in 2012. Many of the areas that were hit by Hurricane Sandy are densely populated and also near water which makes evacuation difficult.I intend to make a map that will allow people to live in the affected areas evacuate out of the evacuation zones.</p2>

<h2>Who is the target audience for the information you want to provide?</h2>
<p>The target audience would be residents of the area or disaster planning officials in the government. </p>
<h2>What geographic region does your problem area represent? Please describe it in words (e.g. New Mexico, Alberta Canada, etc.) and define it in terms of a geographic (WGS84) (latitude and longitude) bounding box.</h2>
<p> The area of study is Brooklyn, New York Latitude. The geographic projection for the data is  NAD83 / New York Long Island. The bounding box is Min,Min 912287.07,116411.37 : Max,Max 1067382.51,273617.84    and Longitude   .</p>
<h2>What types of data do you want to include in your project? Include a description (data content: e.g. elevation data, hydrographic survey, etc.) and types (i.e. raster, vector).</h2>
<p> I would like to use shapefiles that would be helpful for my project. For example, using a polygon layer that notes evacuation zones. Shapefiles that are point data for emergency services like the fire department and police department. I will also need vector data for specific buroughs and neighborhoods in Brooklyn.  </p></li>
<h2>What projection will you use for the presentation of your project data? Again, describe it, provide your reasoning for selection, and provide the corresponding EPSG code.</h2>
<p> I am using EPSG: 2623. NAD83 / New York Long Island for the projection. The majority of my data was in this projection already and I didn't want to have to reproject anything into a different projection and make it more complicated. </p></li>
<h2>Where do you anticipate acquiring data for the project from?</h2>
<p>I plan on acquiring data mostly from the NYS GIS clearinghouse https://gis.ny.gov</p>
<h2>What barriers to acquiring and processing the needed data do you anticipate?</h2>
<p> Anytime you are downloading data I'm always prepared for the worst. Often times the data you think you are downloading is what you receive. For example, I downloaded a .shp file from gis.ny.gov that was supposed to be the boundaries for the different neighborhoods in New York and it was but the only had number associated with the boundaries which was less than helpful. Another problem is too much information in the attribute table and you have to modify the data for your needs which can be time consuming. Raster data can also take a long time to download and depending on the data set might have clouds or other types of noise that can make it difficult to work with. </p>
</ul>
<p>While you are going to continue to acquire additional data for the project over the next couple of assignments, begin acquiring data for your selected project now. Specifically, find 5 datasets that are consistent with your description of the problem you are going to work on, and use <code>ogrinfo</code> or <code>gdalinfo</code> and any associated metadata to describe them in brief by answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<p>What is the name of the dataset?</p></li>
<p> 1. NYhez.shp </p>
<p> This is a vector data set of the hurrican evacuation zones in New York City </p>
<p> <img src="https://github.com/cmachojl/geog485/blob/gh-pages/DD3nyhez.JPG?raw=true" /></p>

<p> 2. NYnta.shp </p>
<p> This is a vector data set of specific neighborhoods within New York City. </p>

<p> <img src="https://github.com/cmachojl/geog485/blob/gh-pages/DD3nynta.JPG?raw=true" /></p>

<p>3. facilities.shp </p>
<p> This is a vector data set of facilities in New York City. Facilities such has hospitals, schools, police and fire stations.  </p>

<p> <img src="https://github.com/cmachojl/geog485/blob/gh-pages/DD3facilities.JPG?raw=true" /></p>


<p> 4. Nybb </p>
<p> This is a vector data set of the boundary of the New York City buroughs. </p>

<p> <img src="https://github.com/cmachojl/geog485/blob/gh-pages/DD3nybb.JPG?raw=true" /></p>
