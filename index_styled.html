	<h1>Lab Assignment / Assignment #1</h1>
	<h2>Question 1: From examining the display in your web browser and the structure of the source code in the page, what effect (if any) does the white space (i.e. tabs, blank lines, multiple spaces) have on what is displayed in the browser?</h2>
	<p>Tabs, white spaces and blank lines do not seem to alter the code. New lines are started with header and paragraph tags. The tabs did not indent the text and blank lines occured when using h tags.</p>
	<h2>Question 2: How are the h1 tags and h2 elements from the source code displayed differently?</h2>
	<p> The h1 tag is in a larger font than the h2 tag.</p>
	<h2>Question 3: 
    What type of element would you use to create additional list elements in either the “topic” or “data type” lists on the page.</h2>
	<p>To create an additional list the type of element you would use would be a ul tag for an unoreded list or an ol tag for an ordered list</p>
