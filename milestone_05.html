	<h1>Milestone 5</h1>
	<h2>Briefly describe each dataset based upon the information from the web site.</h2>
	<p>1. New Mexico, 2010 Census Place- This is a vector data set that gives information based of the 2010 census. There is a map preview that gives the boundaries for New Mexico and the counties. The data is available in the following formats .shp .zip gml kml gejson json csv and xls. This data was updated on 6/6/2011.Metadata is also available in bothe xml and html formats 

<p></p>2. HSIP Hospitals in New Mexico- This is a vector data set that provides point data of hospitals in the state of New Mexico. There is a map preview on the website which is the boundary for the state of New Mexico and the hospital points. This data is avialable in shp ip kmz csv xls json gml and geoson. The available web services are wms and wfs. Metadata is provided in xml and html.The date this data was posted is 2/4/2010.</P>

<p></p>3.Santa Fe County Landsat Mosaic, 2011- This is a raster data set and is imagery from the landsat satellite. This data was posted on the website on 8/27/2012. Metadata is provided in both xml and html. The preview provides boundaries of where the image is from. This is an img file. The service provided are wms and wcs. </p>

<h2>What is the projection/coordinate system for the data product? If it is undefined, note it.</h2>

<p>Santa Fe Landsat image Projection UTM, Zone 13 Spheroid WGS 84, Datum WGS 84</P>

<p> New Mexico Census data: (-109.049170, 31.783148) - (-103.043560, 37.000020)  </p>

<h2> If it is a vector dataset, how many features does it have? </h2>
<p> The hospital data set has 55 features </p>
<p> The census data set has 443 features </p>

<h2> If it is a raster dataset, what is the pixel resolution (include units) of the dataset? </h2>

<p> The pixel resolution for the Santa Fe image is (30.000000000000000,-30.000000000000000) </p>
	
<h2>Use proj or cs2cs (I suggest you use cs2cs) to calculate the coordinates of the spatial extent of the datasets that you downloaded in UTM Zone 13N, NAD27. Paste the input and output of the command(s) into your writeup.  </h2>
