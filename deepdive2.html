<h3>Question 1</h3>
<h3>What request type is common across all three (WMS, WFS, WCS) OGC web services that we have learned about? </p>

<p>GetCapabilities is common among the WMS, WFS, WCS web services.</p>
<h3>Answer the following questions about a WMS GetCapabilities request<h3>
<h3>Question 2<h3>
<h3>What are the required parameters, and what do they represent?<h3> 
<p>The required parameters are</p>
<p> SERVICE=WMS, which represents service type and REQUEST=GetCapabilities which represents request name.</p>
<h3>What is returned in response to a WMS GetCapabilities request?</h3>
<p>In a GetCapabilities request Service Metadata is returned which is an XML file representing information about a specific WMS service and its component layers.</p>
<h3>Answer the following questions about a WMS GetMap request</h3>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<h3>What are the required parameters, and what do they represent?<h3> 
<p>Version=version, REQUEST=map, REQUEST=GetMap, LAYERS=layers_list, STYLES=style_list, SRS-namespace identifier, BBOX=minx, miny, maxx, maxy, Width=output_width, Height=output_height, FORMAT=output_format<p>

<h3>What is returned in response to a WMS GetMap request? </h3>
<p>The response that is returned from a GetMap request are graphic files representing one or more layers from a single WMS service for a specified area of interest, and optionally, for a specified point in time. </p>
<h3>What is the significance of transparency in WMS requests?</h3>
<p>Transparency is the background transparency of a map its default=false.</p>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<h3>What OGC request would you use to inform the configuration of a client application (like ArcGIS) about an OGC service that you want to add layers from?</h3>
<p>Answer</p>
<h3>Which OGC request would you submit under the following circumstances (include both the service type [e.g. WMS, WFS, WCS], and the request [e.g. GetMap, GetCapabilities, GetCoverage, etc.] in your answer)</h3>
<p> Answer</p>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<h3>You want a map image representing three layers of data in a single JPEG for a specified area of interest. </h3>
<p>You would use a WMS GetMap request.</p> 
<p>You want to retrieve data representing geometries and associated attributes for a road network, with the returned data in GML.</p> 
<p>You would use WFS, GetFeature request.</p>
<p>You want to retrieve data representing a digital elevation model (a raster dataset) in the form of a GeoTIFF.</p>
<p>You would use WCS, GetCoverage request.</p>
<h3>Question 6 - What are the EPSG codes of the following Spatial Reference Systems</h3>
<p>WGS 84 (Geodetic CRS [geographic 2d]) : EPSG 4326</p>
<p>NAD83 / UTM zone 13N : EPSG 26913</p>
<p>NAD27 / UTM zone 13N:  EPSG 26713</p>
<h3>Use the cs2cs utility to convert the following WGS84 Geographic Coordinates into UTM Zone 13, NAD83 coordinates. Include your cs2cs command and output in your writeup.</h3>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
